<p>
The history of the United States Capitol Building begins in 1793. Since then, the U.S. Capitol has been built, burnt, rebuilt, extended and restored. The Capitol that we see today is the result of several major periods of construction; it stands as a monument to the ingenuity, determination and skill of the American people. In accordance with the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Residence.html">"Residence Act"</a> passed by Congress in 1790, President <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington">George Washington</a> in 1791 selected the area that is now the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.">District of Columbia</a> from land ceded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland">Maryland</a>. He also selected three commissioners to survey the site and oversee the design and construction of the capital city and its government buildings. The commissioners, in turn, hired the French engineer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L%27Enfant">Pierre Charles L'Enfant</a> to plan the new city of Washington. He located the Capitol at the elevated east end of the Mall, on the brow of what was then called Jenkins' Hill. The site was, in L'Enfant's words, "a pedestal waiting for a monument."
