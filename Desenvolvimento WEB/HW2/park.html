	For me It was one of the beste experience that I lived. I never saw a place like that one. Also for me It was more incredible because I love movies and there we can see how movies are builded. Over the years, Universal Studios Florida has not limited itself to attractions based on its own vast film library. It has occasionally licensed popular characters from other rival studios, many of whom did not operate theme parks themselves. Some examples include Ghostbusters and Men in Black, <a href="http://www.canalsony.com"> (Sony's Columbia Pictures)</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/" >The Simpsons</a> (20th Century Fox) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek"> Shrek (DreamWorks Animation)</a>.

	From its inception in 1982,[3] Universal Studios Florida was designed as a theme park and a working studio. It was also the first time that Universal Studios had constructed an amusement park "from the ground up." However, the proposed project was put on hold until 1986, when a meeting between Steven Spielberg, a co-founder for the park, and Peter N. Alexander prompted for the creation of a Back to the Future simulator ride in addition to the already planned King Kong based ride.[4] Spielberg also have noticed how much of the park can be competitively if it can compete with the nearby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney">Walt Disney World</a> and <a href="http://seaworld.com/">Seaworld</a>.

	A major component of the original park in Hollywood is its studio tour, which featured several special-effects exhibits and encounters built into the tour, such as an attack by the great white shark from the film Jaws. For its Florida park, Universal Studios took the concepts of the Hollywood tour scenes and developed them into larger, stand-alone attractions. As an example, in Hollywood, the studio tour trams travel close to a shoreline and are "attacked" by Jaws before they travel to the next part of the tour. In Florida, guests entered the "Jaws" attraction and would board a boat touring the fictitious Amity Harbor, where they encountered the shark, then exited back into the park at the conclusion of the attraction. Universal Studios Florida originally had a Studio Tour attraction that visited the production facilities, but that tour has since been discontinued.
